## Tested Passwords

| Password        | Strength | Tool Feedback                                                                 |
|-----------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `12345`         | Weak     | Too short, all numeric, very common                                            |
| `password`      | Weak     | Commonly used, lacks variation, easily guessable                              |
| `hello@123`      | Medium   | Contains letters and numbers, but lacks length and complexity                 |
| `Cyber2024`    | Medium   | Includes special character and mix of cases but can be more complex           |
| `X!t9V@z7M#`    | Strong   | Long, random, contains upper/lowercase, numbers, special characters           |
| `5uP3r$ecurePwd!`| Strong  | Complex, long, includes symbols, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers            |

## Summary of Findings

- **Weak Passwords**: Often short, predictable, and use only letters or numbers.
- **Medium Passwords**: Add a bit of complexity but still may follow common patterns or be too short.
- **Strong Passwords**: Long, unpredictable, and use a combination of character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).

---

## Best Practices for Strong Passwords

1. Use at least **12 characters**.
2. Combine **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters**.
3. Avoid using **common words or patterns** (e.g., `12345`, `password`).
4. Do **not reuse passwords** across websites.
5. Use a **password manager** to generate and store complex passwords securely.

## Common Password Attack Techniques

- **Brute Force Attack**: Tries all combinations until it succeeds. Short and simple passwords are vulnerable.
- **Dictionary Attack**: Uses lists of common passwords or words. Easily cracks predictable or reused passwords.
- **Credential Stuffing**: Uses breached login credentials on other platforms.

## Conclusion

Password complexity directly affects the difficulty for attackers to guess or crack credentials. Using strong, unique passwords is a key part of securing online accounts and systems.
