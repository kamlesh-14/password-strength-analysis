# password-strength-analysis

## Objective:
This project focuses on evaluating password strength using online password strength checker tools. The aim is to understand what contributes to a strong password and how complexity plays a crucial role in securing accounts from common cyber attacks.

## Tasks Performed
Created multiple passwords of varying complexity.
Evaluated them using popular online password strength checkers.
Documented scores and feedback for each password.
Identified best practices and common weaknesses.
Researched common password attack techniques.
Summarized findings and provided practical recommendations.

## Tools Used
[passwordmeter.com](https://passwordmeter.com/)
[passwordmonster.com (or similar tool)](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/)
[nordpass.com](https://nordpass.com/secure-password/)

## Project Deliverables
A detailed MD file containing:
Passwords (non-sensitive and for demo)
Tool feedback
Strength scores
A summarized report of:
Best practices
Attack methods (brute force, dictionary, etc.
How complexity improves password security

## Key Learnings
Importance of length, symbol inclusion, and unpredictability.
Risks of common patterns like “123456” or “qwerty”.
Insights into how attackers attempt to crack passwords.
How to educate users on creating secure credentials.
